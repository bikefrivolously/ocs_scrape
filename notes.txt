TODO
- find a way to pull stock quantity, or remove quantity from the variant_stock table
- get rid of many-many relationship and table between product and variant. It should be one product can have many variants.
- logging
- find database file relative to script's directory (rather than relative to cwd).
- clean up / rename files (ocs_scrape.py, scrape.py, ocs_scraper.py)
- track availability over time (move the available boolean from variant to variant_stock)

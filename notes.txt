Scraping the site:
- Get all product.json pages and put them in a big list
- Filter the list by some criteria and return only what we're interested in (English pages for dried flower cannabis)
- For every item in the list
  - Parse out the product details
  - Parse out the variant details
  - If the product is in the DB already and all of it's variants are as well:
    - Check products.json update time vs DB update time. If products.json is more recent:
      - fetch the product page and get stock numbers. Otherwise, get each variant's most recent stock number from the DB.
    - update the fields in products
  - Else: fetch the product page for stock numbers, 
  - Add an entry in product_attributes with the current refresh time
  - Check if any variant_ids in product_variant are missing from our new data. If yes, print a message. (maybe remove it?)
  - For every variant
    - Add an entry in product_variant (if not already existing)
    - Create or update variant table
    - Add an entry in variant_stock with the current refresh time
- Check if any product ids in the DB are not in the filtered list. If so, set removed flag in DB and print something
